# AI LifeBalance – Personalized Planner for Study, Work & Well-being  #
AI LifeBalance is a smart assistant that organizes daily tasks, balances study/work with personal chores, and maintains healthy habits. It adapts to each user’s energy levels and deadlines to create an optimized schedule with gentle health reminders. Built with Python, Streamlit, LangChain, and SQLite, it offers AI-driven scheduling, break/hydration notifications, and simple productivity analytics. To run locally: clone the repo, create and activate a virtual environment, install dependencies from `requirements.txt`, add your Gemini API key in a `.env` file as `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here`, and start the app with `streamlit run app.py`. “Plan smarter, live healthier.”
